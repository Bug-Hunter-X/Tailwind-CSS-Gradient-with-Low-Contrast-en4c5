# Tailwind CSS Gradient with Low Contrast

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradients. If the colors specified for the `from` and `to` properties are too similar or lack sufficient contrast, the resulting gradient may be barely visible or completely unnoticeable. 

The `bug.html` file shows an example where the gradient is hardly distinguishable. The `solution.html` file provides a solution with better color contrast.
