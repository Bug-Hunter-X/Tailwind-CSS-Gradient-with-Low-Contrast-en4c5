```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a div with a gradient background. However, if the `from` and `to` colors are too similar or don't have enough contrast, the gradient might not be noticeable.
